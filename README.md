When I was buying used Android phones, some were sold to me as-is and locked in various states. Some I were able to bypass with exploits on specific old versions of Android 5,6,7,8 etc. Others, I could bypass using tools I found online. Others I had to reflash the phone after putting in recovery mode. As there's a lot of device drivers and random versions, I don't recommend you install anything on your main workstation and likely works best in Windows 10.
